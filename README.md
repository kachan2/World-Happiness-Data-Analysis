## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the distribution and historical changes of "happiness" scores calculated with varying measurement factors. To do so, this project contains multiple data visualizations that plots the World Happiness Reports data between the years 2015 and 2022 with the following components: 

1. **World Map**: an interactive choropleth map that shows the distribution of happiness scores around the world for each year
2. **Line Graph**: shows the fluctuations of various selected measurement factors for a selected country over the period of time
3. **Correlation Plot**: shows the correlation coefficient between various measurement factors for a selected country

By analyzing the different relationships and distributions of various measurement factors could be used for future plans and efforts toward improving the quality of life for people around the world (finding an area of focus that impacts one or more of the measurements that impact the happiness score). 

## Data
The CSV files used in this project were sourced from kaggle (refer to the *References* section), but the data itself comes from [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/archive/) which "... uses global survey data to report how people evaluate theor own lives...". The csv files contain various measurements for each country for a specified year, including: GDP per capita (economy), social support (family), life expectancy (health), freedom (choice to make decisions), trust (government corruption), and generosity (donations, charity...). Each factor has its own column in the csv file. Most importantly is the Score column which contains the ladder score that contains a calculated weighting based on how people rate their current lives from a scale of 1 to 10.
